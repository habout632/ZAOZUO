# ZAOZUO
Our Goal is to implement ZAO Faceswap Effect perfectly with same performance(translated only by one image, less than 5 seconds each process) and effect(not weired).

we have tried following models ,and these methods failed due to performance and effect.
## Deepfake

## PrNet
really fast, but it is too fake!

some methods need to be implemented
